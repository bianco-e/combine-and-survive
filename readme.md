# Combine & Survive
## Strategy game

### Tech:
* Vanilla JS
* HTML
* CSS

### How to play:
The goal is to reach the greatest number of discoveries by dragging and dropping cards
- Only 2 cards can be combined at a time in this edition
- Some cards can be combined themselves

ENJOY!

### TODO:
* Add extra visual effect when health decreases
* Add person inventory to equip clothes/weapons
* Highlight created card when it already exists
* Update readme
* Split CSS files
* Optimize card images
* Combine more than 2 cards (combine field on bottom bar)
* Make more cards consumable after combining (seeds, water when boiled)
* Add actions if specific cards are next to each other (i.e. Bull next to Sprout would eat it, Worm next to Apple would rotten it)
* Make bull poop after certain seconds alive, make bull drop raw meat (-health) when killed
* Make Dirt drop Worm when combined with Person
* Add a button to display discovered combinations recipes (probably add next items to discover)?
* Add milestones/badges (i.e. Fisherman, Chef, Herbalist, N of discoveries, Hunter, Builder)
* Use Typescript
